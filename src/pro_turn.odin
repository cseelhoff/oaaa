Pro AI Turn Implementation

This file implements a TripleA-style Pro AI turn structure designed for fast MCTS rollouts.
The Pro AI makes quick, reasonable decisions to reach terminal states faster than random play.

Turn Phases (matching TripleA structure):
1. Purchase Phase - Decide what units to buy
2. Combat Move Phase - Move units to attack territories
3. Combat Phase - Resolve all battles
4. Non-Combat Move Phase - Move remaining units to safe positions
5. Place Units Phase - Place newly purchased units
6. End Turn Phase - Collect income and advance to next player

Key Differences from play_full_turn:
- Makes strategic decisions rather than enumerating all possibilities
- Focuses on quick evaluation and good-enough moves
- Designed for rollout speed, not exhaustive search

Phase 1: Purchase Phase

Pro AI strategic purchasing decisions are implemented in pro_purchase.odin

- Evaluating current board state
- Determining strategic priorities (offense vs defense)
- Purchasing units that best serve immediate needs
- Considering factory placement if economically viable

Phase 2: Combat Move Phase

Pro AI combat movement strategy is implemented in pro_combat_move.odin
This includes:
- Identifying vulnerable enemy territories

- Moving fighters and bombers to support key attacks
- Positioning naval units for amphibious assaults
- Moving ground units to maximize attack power
- Loading transports with invasion forces

Future Enhancement Notes:

The stub functions above should eventually implement Pro AI decision-making logic:

1. Territory Evaluation:
   - Calculate value of each territory (IPC value, strategic importance)
   - Assess threat level (enemy units nearby)
   - Determine control status (friendly, enemy, contested)

2. Attack Planning:
   - Calculate battle odds for potential attacks
   - Prioritize high-value, low-risk targets
   - Consider follow-up attacks and defensive needs

3. Defense Planning:
   - Identify threatened friendly territories
   - Calculate minimum defense needed
   - Move units to reinforce weak points

4. Unit Routing:
   - Use movement range efficiently
   - Prefer safe paths when possible
   - Consider unit types and their roles

5. Economic Considerations:
   - Balance offense vs defense spending
   - Prioritize unit types based on game situation
   - Consider long-term strategic value

The goal is to make decisions quickly (no exhaustive search) while still playing reasonably well,
allowing MCTS rollouts to reach terminal states faster than random play.

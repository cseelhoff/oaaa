# Pro AI Combat Move Phase Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive combat movement logic for Pro AI following TripleA's ProCombatMoveAi.java patterns, integrated with OAAA's combat system (combat.odin).

## Implementation Date
October 2, 2025

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Battle Strength Calculation (`calculate_max_attack_strength`)

**Purpose**: Calculate maximum possible attack power from all units that could reach a territory

**Algorithm**:
- **Land Units**: Infantry/Artillery from adjacent territories (1-move), Tanks from 2-move range
- **Air Units**: Fighters within 4-move range, Bombers within 6-move range  
- **Naval Support**: Cruisers/Battleships providing bombardment from adjacent seas
- Uses OAAA combat constants: `INFANTRY_ATTACK`, `ARTILLERY_ATTACK`, `TANK_ATTACK`, `FIGHTER_ATTACK`, `BOMBER_ATTACK`, `CRUISER_ATTACK`, `BATTLESHIP_ATTACK`

**Key Features**:
- Infantry+Artillery combo bonus (supported infantry get +1 attack)
- Uses pre-computed map graph bitsets for efficiency:
  * `mm.l2l_1away_via_land` - adjacent territories
  * `mm.l2l_2away_via_land_bitset` - 2-move tank range
  * `mm.a2a_within_4_moves` - fighter range bitsets
  * `mm.a2a_within_6_moves` - bomber range bitsets
  * `mm.l2s_1away_via_land` - adjacent seas for bombardment

### 2. Unit Assignment Logic (`assign_units_to_attack`)

**Purpose**: Select specific units to attack a territory, balancing victory probability with minimal losses

**Strategy** (based on TripleA Pro AI):
1. Calculate target attack power: `defense_power * 1.5` for ~70% win chance
2. Assign units in cost-efficiency order:
   - **Infantry** first (3 IPCs, most expendable)
   - **Artillery** second (4 IPCs, support bonus)
   - **Tanks** from extended range (6 IPCs, powerful)
   - **Fighters** if needed (10 IPCs, air superiority)
   - **Bombers** as last resort (12 IPCs, expensive)

**Unit Selection Process**:
- Phase 1: Land units from adjacent territories
- Phase 2: Tanks from 2-move range if insufficient
- Phase 3: Air support (fighters preferred over bombers)
- Phase 4: Calculate final win percentage

**Key Features**:
- Prefers cheap, expendable units over expensive ones
- Infantry+Artillery combo provides ~2x attack power
- Only adds as many units as needed to reach target power
- Returns estimated win percentage via `estimate_battle_odds()`

### 3. Battle Odds Estimation (`estimate_battle_odds`)

**Purpose**: Estimate win probability based on attack/defense power ratio

**Algorithm**: Logistic function for smooth probability curve
```
odds = 1 / (1 + e^(-k * (ratio - 1.0)))
where:
  ratio = attack_power / defense_power
  k = 2.5 (steepness parameter)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Ratio > 1.5: ~70-80% win chance (favorable)
- Ratio = 1.0: ~50% win chance (even battle)
- Ratio < 0.7: ~20-30% win chance (unfavorable)

**Based On**: TripleA ProOddsCalculator.java battle simulation

### 4. Reachability Optimizations

**Air Unit Reachability**:
- Fixed to use `Air_Bitset` bitwise operations (NOT built-in bit_set)
- `Air_Bitset :: distinct [4]u64` requires explicit bitwise AND
- Pattern: `(mm.a2a_within_N_moves[src] & target_bitset) != {}`

**Map Graph Usage**:
- Leverages pre-computed connectivity bitsets from map.odin
- O(reachable) iteration instead of O(all_territories) checking
- Consistent with optimizations in `pro_move_validate.odin`

## Integration with OAAA Combat System

### Combat Value Constants (from combat.odin)
```odin
INFANTRY_ATTACK = 1
ARTILLERY_ATTACK = 2  
TANK_ATTACK = 3
FIGHTER_ATTACK = 3
BOMBER_ATTACK = 4
CRUISER_ATTACK = 3
BATTLESHIP_ATTACK = 4

INFANTRY_DEFENSE = 2
ARTILLERY_DEFENSE = 2
TANK_DEFENSE = 3
FIGHTER_DEFENSE = 4
BOMBER_DEFENSE = 1
```

### Special Combat Mechanics Considered

1. **Infantry+Artillery Combo**: 
   - Each infantry can be "supported" by one artillery
   - Supported infantry get bonus attack
   - Formula: `min(INF_count, ARTY_count)` determines supported pairs

2. **Naval Bombardment**:
   - Cruisers and Battleships can bombard from adjacent seas
   - Provides free attack before land combat begins
   - Calculated in `calculate_max_attack_strength`

3. **Submarine Mechanics** (from combat.odin):
   - Subs get sneak attack if no enemy destroyers present
   - Destroyers prevent submarine submerging
   - Accounted for in battle odds (simplified model)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed
1. **Battle Strength Calculation**:
   - Test with various unit combinations
   - Verify infantry+artillery combo bonus
   - Check naval bombardment calculation

2. **Unit Assignment Logic**:
   - Test cost-efficiency ordering
   - Verify minimum unit assignment for target odds
   - Check that expensive units only used when necessary

3. **Battle Odds Estimation**:
   - Test with known attack/defense ratios
   - Verify odds curve matches expectations
   - Edge cases: no defenders, overwhelming force

### Integration Testing
1. Full combat move phase execution
2. Verify units move to correct territories
3. Check combat resolution after moves
4. Ensure capital defense maintained

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **find_attack_options**: O(n) where n = number of Land_IDs
- **calculate_max_attack_strength**: O(territories + air_units)
  - Land units: O(adjacent + 2-away territories)
  - Air units: O(friendly territories with planes)
- **assign_units_to_attack**: O(units_in_range)
- **Overall Phase**: O(n * m) where n = attackable territories, m = avg units per territory

### Space Complexity
- Attack_Option structures: O(n * u) where n = territories, u = units
- Temporary bitsets: O(1) - reuses map graph bitsets
- Unit assignment arrays: O(u) per attack

### Optimization Notes
1. Uses pre-computed map graph bitsets (no pathfinding needed)
2. Early termination in unit assignment (stops at target power)
3. Reuses Air_Bitset for reachability checks
4. Minimal allocations via dynamic arrays

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Battle Odds**: Simplified logistic model, not full Monte Carlo simulation
2. **Amphibious Assaults**: Uses existing transport system, not fully integrated
3. **Naval Combat**: Not yet implemented (sea zone attacks)
4. **Capital Defense**: Basic check, not comprehensive threat assessment
5. **Unit Coordination**: Doesn't optimize multi-territory attack sequences

### Future Enhancements (from TripleA Pro AI)
1. **Better Battle Simulation**:
   - Monte Carlo simulation (10,000+ iterations)
   - Account for AA guns, bombardment, tactical casualties
   - Retreat probability calculation

2. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Territory value calculation (IPC production + strategic importance)
   - Can-hold-after-capture analysis
   - Counter-attack probability
   - TUV (Total Unit Value) swing optimization

3. **Advanced Unit Assignment**:
   - Multi-battle optimization (allocate units across multiple attacks)
   - Reserve units for defense
   - Air unit landing zone planning
   - Transport efficiency (units per transport cost)

4. **Naval Combat**:
   - Sea zone control battles
   - Submarine wolfpack tactics
   - Carrier protection
   - Blockade establishment

5. **Capital Defense Logic**:
   - Threat assessment from all enemy territories
   - Reserve force calculation
   - Dynamic defense adjustment

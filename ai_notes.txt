Game Overview:
This is an implementation of Axis & Allies Second Edition, a turn-based strategy game.
The game features two teams (Allies and Axis) with 5 players:
- Allies: Russia (RUS), England (ENG), United States (USA)
- Axis: Germany (GER), Japan (JAP)

Unit Movement System:
1. Movement States:
   - UNMOVED: Unit has not been offered a chance to move this turn
   - X_MOVES: Unit has X moves remaining this turn (0, 1, or 2)
   - UNLOADED: (Transport specific) Transport has declined to unload cargo

2. Transport System:
   - Capacity: 5 spaces total
     * Infantry (INF): 2 spaces
     * Artillery (ARTY): 3 spaces
     * Tank (TANK): 3 spaces
     * AA Gun: 6 spaces (exceeds transport capacity)
   - Valid Configurations:
     * TRANS_EMPTY: No cargo
     * TRANS_1I: 1 Infantry
     * TRANS_1A: 1 Artillery
     * TRANS_1T: 1 Tank
     * TRANS_1I_1A: 1 Infantry + 1 Artillery
     * TRANS_2I: 2 Infantry

3. Pre-staging System:
   Transports have a unique "pre-staging" phase where they can move early in a turn
   to position themselves for loading units. This is tracked through state transitions:
   UNMOVED -> [pre-stage decision] -> {2_MOVES, 1_MOVES, 0_MOVES}

Map Structure:
1. Movement Connections:
   - Land-to-Land (l2l): Direct land connections
   - Sea-to-Sea (s2s): Direct sea connections
   - Land-to-Sea (l2s): Where units can load/unload from transports
   - Air-to-Air (a2a): Combines all other connection types for air movement

2. Canals:
   - Connect two sea zones when both required land territories are controlled
   - Tracked via canals_open bitset in game state

State Management:
1. Game_State: Core game state required for save/load
2. Game_Cache: Derived data rebuilt from Game_State, includes:
   - Movement validation tables
   - Territory control status
   - Unit availability

3. Unit Tracking:
   - Active units: Belong to current player, includes movement state
   - Idle units: All other players' units, no movement tracking needed

Combat System:
1. Naval Combat:
   - Transports are vulnerable but have no combat power
   - Must be protected by combat ships

2. Bombardment:
   - Battleships and Cruisers can bombard once per turn
   - Tracked via _BOMBARDED state

3. AA Defense:
   - AA guns roll against attacking aircraft
   - 1 die per plane (max 3 dice per AA gun)
   - Rolls occur before regular combat
